Description: JDK/API verification tools
 Animal Sniffer provides tools to assist verifying that classes compiled with a
 newer JDK/API are compatible with an older JDK/API.
 .
 The Java Boot Classpath Detector is an executable jar file which tries to
 determine the boot classpath of the Java Runtime and outputs that classpath to
 the standard output.
 .
 Animal Sniffer Annotations provides Java 1.5+ annotations which allow marking
 methods which Animal Sniffer should ignore signature violations of. Animal
 Sniffer is designed to detect when you have used classes/methods/fields which
 are not part of the JRE that you are targeting. There are certain situations
 when you might be compiling with a newer JDK than the JRE you are targeting.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer ANT Tasks can be used to build signatures of APIs and to
 check your classes against previously generated signatures.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer Enforcer Rule is used to check your classes against
 previously generated signatures.
 .
 The Animal Sniffer Maven Plugin is used to build signatures of APIs and to
 check your classes against previously generated signatures.
